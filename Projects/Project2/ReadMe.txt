This is a simple Login project that allows a user to login to the application or create a new account. 
The project uses three activities and one helper class to handle the given tasks. 

Lower Fragment: A fragment that holds all options to control the photo application. The fragment is set 
	up to cycle through the photos via buttons. Two check boxes are used to replace the fragment
	with a gridview, not implemented, or cycle through the photos automatically. 

Main Activity: An activity that controls the interaction between both fragments. This activity holds 
	the image array that is used for the shared data.

Shared Data: 

Upper Fragment: A fragment that displays the image file that is currently chosen. This fragment uses
	a ViewModel to refresh the page with a new image.
